Currently each in game character is locked into their class, but multiple characters of each class can be created.

* Mage: 
  * Overview: The mage class focuses on offense by using long range spells to attack enemies. 
  * General Characteristics: Mages operate best by keeping away from enemeies and casting spells to deplete their health bars. Mages have a low health pool and a high mana pool and will die quickly if they let their enemies reach them. However staying too far away will decrease the effectiveness of your spells. Mages have little choice in armor and attack faster than both Rogues and Warriors.
  * Unique Weapon: Mages are able to equip wands and will change the default melee attack to a long range fire ball that shoots from the tip of the wand, until the map's end. This attack travels at a constant speed and its damage decreases the further it travels.

* Rouge: To be implemented in a later update.
  * Overview: The Rogue class balances survivability and damage emphasizes speed to attack for small to moderate amounts of damage while avoiding enemy attacks.

* Warrior: To be implemented in a later update.
  * Overview: The Warrior class focuses on survivabilty by offering a wide selection of armor to increase a character's health bar. Warriors attack slower than both Rogues and Mages but can do more damage with each successful attack.
